                FOUNTAINS. THIS night is pure and clear as thrice refinèd silver.     Silence, the cape of Death, lies heavy Round the bare shoulders of the hills. Faint throbs and murmurs At moments growing to a mutter, then subsiding, Fill the night with mystery and panic. The honey-tonguèd arguings of fountains Stir the air with flutes and gentle voices.-- The graven fountain-masks suffer and weep--Curved with a smile, the poor mouths Clutch at a half-remembered song Striving to forget the agony of ever laughing,-- Laughing while they hear the secrets Echoed from the depths of Earth beneath them. This half-remembered song-- This flow of sad-restrainèd laughter Jars with the jets of youthful water Springing from the twisted masks, For this is but the birth of water; And singing joyfully It springs upon the world And wanders ceaselessly Along its jewelled valleys to the sea, Rattling like rolls of drums The shells and pebbles down its bed. The endless argument of water ceases, A few drops fall heavily, splashing on the marble: A sultan with his treasures Seeking to gain the goodwill of his love, Pouring before her chains of crackling pearls And weeping heavy jealous tears Because she will not heed him.                 PINDAR.PINDAR asleep beneath the planes.    Then every Zephyr shook his shoulder Struck the pale disks Sent silver showers beneath the moon To clothe his young tired body With those pallid leaves. And Pan let from his shuttered hive The snub-nosed honey-bees escape-- A whirr of sound, throb, flutter, Feather-flight of birds, And on the poet's lips The swarm descends to suck his breath. Now Pan has learnt his song And sings it on the mountains, The centaurs gurgling the honeyed waters Take hands from lips, retire to caves; Each satyr, ev'ry grape-gatherer Can hear their panick'd rumblings. Now the song lulls; centaurs breathe again-- To daylight--sniff around; then gallop down the hills;  Beneath the cliffs, poor fishermen Hear thunder-thudding of the hooves, and sail for sea. They think a hissing thunderbolt will fall about their     heads. And from the cliffs the centaurs hear Flutes like bird-flights through the air All regular, then flurry of the wings As breath fails in the player--And fevered pluckings at a harp Are birds beneath a canopy of leaves Who preen their feathers, strike their beaks Upon each quill, re-echoing With air-born ecstasy.--Could one imprison fire within a pipe of glass To catch the surge and shrinkage of its flames, I think we'd have in one small pipe A man could play on, Every plunge through chasms where the winds play, Through bell-clear ringing sounds of rain, Through painted distances aloof as dreams, And every beat their wings make on clouds Reverberant as caverns.--And with these flute-sounds came the floundering Of horns that play among the waves Like porpoises who roll Against the stiffened backs of water That the waves flap When they break sonorously. They say that every sound upon the earth Is mirrored echoed in the upper air And never dies; so when the sound The centaurs heard from passing galleys Were washing like young tides Among the clashing cymbals we call stars-- They broke in foam against the songs The sirens sang, and the stifled cry Of Sappho falling to her death--And still there rose the lyre-strung voice Of Pindar fresh, and honey-sweet, Rejuvenate in spite of Pan. February 11th, 1918. NOTE. There are two legends of Pindar. One tells how when he was asleep in a wood, whilst quite a baby, a swarm of bees settled on his lips. The other describes how Pan stole Pindar's song, and sang it on the mountains. In this poem these two incon- gruous elements have been combined. It is on the same principle that bad Greek wine is improved by the addition of rancid honey.                     Li-Tai-Pé
     (He strolls in the garden after dinner.) FULL moon-fruit hanging on the orchard tree: Wind shakes them--clash of calabashes Full peal of bells--each fruit A honey 'hearted rain drop Falls pattering on the straight-ribbed leaves. I move my eyes then, look around Can hear the frost-flowers raise their heads In ev'ry dewdrop I have crushed--Far back my sinuous footmarks stretch--curved snaiL walk. Then wink my eyes Ah! only one moon, and that As large and round and heavy as an egg-- In branching clouds--the Phoenix nest it is! With half-fledged Phoenix young. Their song now swims upon the air Like painted ships that plough the sea. The wind puffs play among the weeds--Treetops tremble--temple bells clank in the wind-- All flute-sounds in the Phoenix throat.            BRIGHTON PIER.HOW even, flat, and similar These strips of plank beneath our feet. Unconscious, quite, my weary eyes Force me to tread on every joint Of plank to plank. I seem to lay my road Treading flat the boarding as I go, And so I ponder, Think still further, further, from me. Then thump, thump, thump, These leaden feet tread on my mind And bring me back again. Strips of white trouser Shooting to and fro Jumping forward, jerking back, Gay blazers, skirts of flimsy muslin, Squirts of sunshine, flopping hats--The planks re-echoing and springing to the footsteps. Here, at the water's edge, I stop And lean upon the parapet:-- There are pierrots dancing in their booth Flooded with strong draughts of sunlight; They twist and turn beneath the rays Like wisps of faint blue smoke.-- I cannot hear their song: But distant sounds Like bubbles breaking Reach my ears.-- Small waves roll gently forward Raise their tired heads And slowly break to foam-- As sudden as you turn A page over in a book.           FRAGMENT FROM SIRENS. OUR sails were stooping low before the wind--Sails, curvèd like a shell held to the ear That sends far down the listener's soul The faint far singing of the sea Among its labyrinthine valleys and the hills That shew the gilded wreckage of such argosies As toss their heads above these sudden mountains Raised godlike from the level water-plains, And azure-rifted chasms; such ships As break their scornful heads Against the walls of crumbling foam And battlements of far-strung bubbles Strewn star-thick o'er the snow-soft sea. Our curvèd prow was steering for the sun And lightning-swift we passed across the sea Faster, faster, ever faster, faster, We flew from speed to speed Till looking from the ship I saw the jaggèd foam and tear salt spray-- Left hanging in the sea Big grapes for which the sea-god Would thank our ship, as with his scalèd feet He crushed the wine from out the bursting fruit. For many a mile behind our bird-swift ship We left great footmarks in the falling snow Of waves, and patches of dire blue Restrained the knotted whips of spray From striking 'gainst our ship-- A striding horse with every nerve Strained for utmost speed. And so beneath our prow The dashing waves were shattered, melted, As clouds upon a mountain side Sink lower, break asunder, Cling lifeless to the rocks Then vanish to a wisp of smoke. And all the while the red sun drew us down A speck of dust within his giant's draught, A speck fast falling down the slanting sea, Which he had lifted high Its musty dregs to drain.               OUTSKIRTS.THE gold voice of the sunset was most clearly in the air As I wandered through the outskirts of the town. And here disposed upon the grass, I see Confetti-thick the amorous couples,--What thoughts, what scenes, evoke, evaporate In leaden minds like theirs? Can I create them? These things Which mean the happiness of multitudes? A river bank, grass for a dancing-floor, The concertina's wail, and then the darkening day. Raise your eyes from ground to trees And see them stretch elastically Tall and taller,--then look along The banks all frayed of the canal Where we are sitting,--the water Lies like a sword With marks of rust Where the sun has caught it. Lie back and listen, Watch the reflections. You see the ripples run among the leaves, Brush them aside, like painted birds That sing, within the lattices The sun's hot bars make with the branches. In China I am told, my dear, The temples are outlined with bells That swing in the wind, or clash Beneath the rain-showers. So when these ripples play among the trees Or any insect drops upon the water The rings and circles spread Make the whole trees shiver, And far down you hear Clash upon clash, the ringing Of the bells that jangle with the leaves. You cannot pierce those distances? Look up! Look up! Night is slowly coming to fill the valleys, Drench the hills, and free us From the suffocation of the sunset. On lands all turbulent with heat The small white houses dancing On the rim of the horizion,--like aproned children In a schoolyard--are stilled. The far-off hills stand solitary Made yellow by the sun. Beneath them where the river winds You hear the spirting of a gramophone-- A fountain playing with discoloured water; And the strumming of a piano, Too far for voice to carry Jerks like a mote before our eyes. For all the instruments men make Play on a public holiday, That birdlike we may play upon a reed, Or let a nightingale we've made Sing among our trees of sentiment, December 31st, 1917.                TAHITI.WHEN the hood of night comes on the land My ship is rocked by the sunset wind-- Shrill voices from the town Cleave the air like darts; When they sing in chorus It were as if steel arrows of the day, The showers of rain, rebounded to the dome of air. When one alone shouts loud, his jagged voice Blares like a trumpet. Banjos and drums Beat, twang, and throb hysterically Outside the mud-built huts. Far off, the sun, caught spider-like In its cloud-web, is seething down the sea And churns the waves, spatters them with blood. Despairingly it waves red tentacles, clutching Fiercely each wool-white wave crest, then splutters out-- Ashore, the tall trees flap their foliage, Cut out like stage-trees carved in canvas;-- The leaves whip the trees as ropes flick the masts Of every salt-fed ship. Then the hood of night comes lower, and from the shore, The Babel grows.               --I dream that I too, sing-- Lanterns are lit,--great stairs of light Shake in the water; All dank and wet I seem to climb, Swaying on soundless gold--go silently Above the land, unto the distant moon, Alone, and ringing clear as a bell. It is a gong, beaten by the drunkard clouds Which reel on the horizon, and by the echoing laughter     of the stars. --Even the sound dies now, and the white bubble, Drop of milk, seems to feed And love whole worlds, turning gold to silver, All ugliness to beauty.               BARREL-ORGANS.
               I. PRELUDE. RIVER-LIKE, this cold quick wind Swirls and eddies down the street. In the wide level of the sounding sea Sudden pitfalls gape: Deep-laid traps for ships, Great seething hollows, mirrors for the sky, Blue deep chasms flecked with red and gold Blown with foam, and live With salt-stiff't sails and sailors' bodies, Golden treasures and forsaken ships.--And in these hungry seething deeps there lies The fleeting wild reflection of the skies. So in the steady flow of wind That swirls and eddies down the street All sense and sight All sound and sorrow Revolve around us here:-- Fly straight as arrows to this spot And fall around us.--The jaggeèd stones are live with sound, And one can hear the shuffling feet on them Tread low, monotonous, inevitable-- Vast armies marching down the corridors of Time. Oh! how this music throbs And lifts our bodies from the street! Squat chimneys rattle and revolve And you can hear The weathercocks fly helter-skelter.-- Tall drink shops with bedizened fronts Decked out with golden letters; Inside them voices raised in quarrel Seem in an instant to jump nearer For the swing-doors with frosted glass And bars so thick they seem to guard a treasure (Not screen drab ugly drink), Fly open with a squirt of yellow light Which only shews with emphasis The dust and crumbling paper in the gutter. A love-sick ballad with a chorus, The snarl and tin-tongued tremolo of tenors With mellow, even toned basses Make the blind and beer-daft beggars Stamp their feet and swing their arms in unison, So they forget the cold and hungry vigil for a ha'pence. The doors swing to, and there is no no more light. The darkness throbs around one like the pulse Within a frightened animal. On either side stretch archways Deep like sleep and hopeless as the sea.-- A drunkard shuffling his slipshod feet Towards his dreary starving home, Sings in an even yellow voice: Sings of pleasures he has never tasted, But sings with full conviction. The shop-signs creak and rattle in the wind And from far-off a clock strikes (half-heartedly). The passage of the hours is uniform; They glide together like the tapping of a drum.-- Our lives are but as sand within the hour-glass: One half is up, the other down. So,--like the ever shifting sea Devouring misery eats up All the inroads of prosperity-- Just as the fangs of seething foam Which race and slide o'er the tawny sand Are quick withdrawn by the immutable tides.--The moon, young light-haired shepherd Has but to lead away his star-fed flocks The wool-white foaming breakers of the sea, Then pasture them again;-- And when he rests behind those thyme-clad hills, the    clouds, To see the homing stars, striped honey-bees, And shuns the sun-god's ravenous embrace,-- Without a sight of him, the dragon-writhing foam To the gentle piping of his wind-stopped flute Draws back again.--                Our lives are short, And do we differ but by our degrees of misery. We have a solace.--Listen then:                II. THE FEATHERED HAT.OH! how this music throbs and lifts our feet! That day the sky was molten gold, The wide fresh-smelling Earth was dancing Beneath the glittering sun-shafts.--One side, the street was dark, As deep and cool as water-wells, The other was ablaze with light:-- Great bars, feet thick, shot down Between the Sun's hot eyelashes ; Motors with their rush and whirr Shot into heated glamour, then came Black and dull, alternately, Between these blazing shafts of heat. The organ plays a slow and measured waltz. I had my best hat with the feathers in it; My boots were thick with dust, I held up my skirt and swayed, Could not dance, the heat was such. I moved so slow, grew tired and more tired,-- Could think of nothing.              Then of a sudden came the syncopation; It seemed to clutch my heart, My nerves came strung like banjo-strings--I seemed to twang them with my hands and toes, My heavy boots throbbed like catapults a-shooting!--       Reverberate thud of thunder-drops,        Shafts and chasms of blinding light        Cavalry gallop of falling leaves        Crackle and spark of shooting stars.                THE MOON.THE white nightingale is hidden in the branches    And heavy leafage of the clouds. She pours down her song-- Cascades threaded like pearls, And the winds, her many-noted flutes Flood forth their harmony.-- But the Earth turns away Swinging in its air and water-rocked cradle.                "THE MAYOR OF MURCIA."
                    I. SOLILOQUY. THE shifting sand lies flat and high    As the stand from which an orator Sees each human head, a petalled flower Turning towards the Sun its benefactor. All this I must destroy; Beating to a metal disc Each feeling flower, to carve it To the leer of cunning, clutch of greed, Or smile of sacrifice. I stand here now: This crowd it seems my duty to command Is still afar off. Yet the sea Is here for me to practice on: Each wave a hoary head Nigh tumbling from its long bent body; Each head with white hair blown by my mouthpiece The lean, hard-fingered wind-- Grown old because its thirsty hands Can never span a shape whose bulk Will stop and give it nourishment. So the insensate sea strives on; And when the far wine-stained breath Of the Sun panting after his horses, Cools the beard and stops the sea god's conch-- Then in fury all the mermen Thrash their tails and beat their fins together. Always clamour, rattling of pebbles, strife, And the greedy gaping of the quicksands. Now as the shadow of a frown On the face of God Is shown by the darkening of a waving cornfield, So, as night damps the gilt glory of the Sun As he stoops like a husbandman to till the Earth, Mighty sweat pouring from under his gorgeous turban      of cloud, The whole great Earth heaves a sigh And all the blossoms of the foam draw in their heads, All the harvest of the unfilled sea folds itself to sleep. Then from far off the town Raises its domes and spires--they seem A troop of elephants with glittering eyes of glass And swaying castles on their backs: The whole town sways towards me Pouring out its people, Who gather in the streets, march on: Hubbub throb of drums, Clangour and thrash of bells, And the measured march And stamp of feet;--A crash of movement On four short notes: Gestures of a marionette For either arm and both his legs-- And trumpet-calls Forked and quick as lightning.--             The crowd all gay with colour Blown along the road Like confetti when a wedding's over. Bars of colour, streaks of colour And sharp notes like a rapier's thrust. And the fevered clanging of the bells Rings out still more and more : Cataracts, curved blades of steel Falling        down            down Through ice cold caverns: The clash of shields When ship meets ship And the fighters leap from boat to boat, The sea tossing her blue shoulders And the spray running salt unaccustomed tears Down every eager face: The whole wide Earth trembles and totters With the stamp of myriad feet: The fret and fury of a mighty army Following the foe through a level land. Swift as Eagles the Saracen horse Fled my army through the sun-scorched sand. The furious tramping of horses stirred the desert Making the sand ring like a trumpet, Echoing the hoots, the howls, the heavy stamp of hooves Raising hurricanes of dust to hide the stars,--Wind-riven curtains of sand To hide those whirling dancers from our sight. My mind now hovers like a vulture Seeing down-stretched before him Dim valleys filled with memories, High peaks enreddened by the sunset fires And gloomy depths, clothed black Beneath the coverlet of sleep, forgetfulness. And now I hover like this vulture Swimming 'gainst the star-strewn spaces of the wind: Or like a rock stand undismayed The peals, the clattering throbs, and splash of foam From all this sea of upturned heads And bodies all poignant with colour: Great waves of sun-touched dyes As brilliant, swift, and shrill As when the Sun with gorgeous fingers Plucks the watery thrill of music From the star-high lyre That echoes from the clouds To touch the Earth all resonant With rippling carillons of rain.               And now I have to speak,-- Explain the objects we're assembled for.                II. THE SPEECH. "Citizens of Murcia, slaves to these,--By my command you're gathered here. I see on every forehead lines of care; Each body's bowed and worn with toil.-- For many years you've laboured, Tilled and reaped your harvests--Golden corn and vine-clusters Ripened with the sun's red blood, And when the burning hours are dead, Refreshed with crystal emanation-- Dew from the hidden stores Of water in the Earth's black gaping chasms. So in the steady pageantry of years You've garnered treasures Wealth to deck and glorify our town. One part Of this, our solemn duty You've already done. Great girdling walls Which circle round the town Keep off our foes--a casque of steel Upon a warrior's head keeps off all blows As lustily as these star-aspiring towers. And in the evening the droning bells Which call to prayer, re-echo From the walls, and peal aloft among the towers, As in the forest on a summer's evening The tall trees are rudely stirred By rush of winged insects Intent upon their honeyed business. Our walls, then, rise triumphant And we can turn our energies to other fields.-- The plain here stretches many a mile Between the town and tawny mountains; The far hills seem battlements Of austere hostile towns--and nearer The clouds hang low like beauty-drugged butterflies Above the flowering fields. Let us girdle the Earth with our handiwork, Bind the blue hills with our strength; The firmament shall know our might and skill. Broad roads shall cross the plains Cleave the gold harvest at their will And clamp the hills down with their might. From the high towers of Murcia The roads shall seem like fluttering pennons Tied to lances pointing at the stars-- For so they seem, when having climbed the hills The roads appear to launch into Eternity.--And we will dig canals to bring The sea's salt breath into the land And heap her shimmering treasures On quays deep-laden with the glittering cornsheaves; So then with holds replenished Our galleons shall sail the seas To distant towns afloat above the tawny sands Like fleets at anchor--                    And when it's evening No sound shall mar the cool canals But they shall stretch like weighty drag-nets And in each mesh you'll see the moon All silver like a draggled scale Amid the drying nets." Now the thin air was torn with cheers And the fiery fountains of the mayor's speech Had set afire the gaping listeners;The swirling smoke of words Had blinded every citizen To sober hard reality.--Great thoughts, those striding bridges Athwart the crystal chasms of our dreams, Seemed like accomplished facts And on the prancing horses of ambition Each conscience leaps the river That runs between the thought and fact accomplished.                III THE RETURN.Look! Here come The trumpet -ers who stab The air With stinging Blasts from Every brazen throat. And after them    The drummers rolling    Of their drums    Until they catch an echo    From distant dome, blue hill, or whispering tree. Think of all the tearing grinding movements irresistible    Rattling of rain that splashes    From rock hard ground    And drips from leaves    That shake together--   One vast swing like pealing bells--   And all the rolling of the sea    Whipped by the wind's salt lashes—    And through this hubbub roar The MAYOR In his new motor Shoots like an arrow; While thick darkness lowers on the land. And so the winds, giant gods, Must hasten home from where Above the foam-flecked sea They feed their ragged cloud-flocks-- And in their haste they loosen from their shoulders The heavy baskets filled with fruits They have gathered in the day, And, careless, drop them by the river That runs through Murcia. On either side there stand The city's clustering domes-- Blood-pulsed fruits From out these copious baskets And fast these fruits now stain the sky, With fierce ensanguined hues. The while the spires Re-echo with the fevered clanging of the bells--Those steel-strong tongues the gods have given them. And now I fear The moon will give A show of sentiment, And splash the land With her maternal milk, Whilst we beneath the walls Let pass the dignitaries--And every brick This arch is made from Is like a honeycomb Replete with sound, Till, like a sea, We hear our voices Break above us, Then reecho--Small ripples lapping The gold shores of all these honey-cells-- The bricks above us. Bright torches dance like motes In the broad moonbeams--And in the tufted trees Like wooden toys The nightingales begin to creak Their laboured song Grinding out run by run each spray, Till, wings relapsed, They stare in vacancy And listen to their neighbours.             IV. THE FESTA.
 The smoke from our torches Hung heavy in the square--An instant's pause--a slight fatigue-- An old man with a white moustache Stooped to his bootlace--The first firework flew, Rockets fell like falling fruit Through the cloud-lattice-- Striking the bars at the second bang. Chains of light slid on the wind Myriad-feathered as the Phoenix Flying to its home--Then the searchlights sprang into the air, And played point-blank Upon the houses--Like fountains lifting Attenuated rainbows in the air, Carving their crystal bulk to stems, Hanging the flowers of water Head downwards in the fleecy clouds, Thick leaves to guard them, Till the fruit downfall Like rain upon the roofs. And while the beams Are playing on the crowd You see all secrets--Every soul is bared As by a secret window in a room, So that the Mayor, who now is on the balcony, Might be an insect with its hundred eyes Probing the swaying flowers beneath it. While below, beyond their heads, Black puppets on the end of strings, The people dangle on the terraces That stretch as taut as tightropes All along the cliffs--And here and there they stumble Try to keep their balance, While, like a nurse's arm    The strains of brass bands keep them up;    And all the night gesticulates    With wooden movements.-- In band-stands wreathed with flowers The military blare out dance-tunes--The brass roars out over the sea. Sibilant strings seem syrup Floating in clouds among the tree-tops, Keeping the drooping acacias to their stems, That drop their distilled dew, Made fragrant with the honey of their breath, Upon the sheen of darker leaves beneath them Where magnolias flaunt their skins Whiter than any woman's, Or pinker, beneath the prying lights.--    Processions now pour in    From every side and quarter--    Music at their head--    People foam at the sides    With a fringe of tin trumpets,    Throwing flowers,    Waving flags,-- The churches open wide their doors So you can see inside them, As into a cake, or the core of a honeycomb. The organs boom out loud Amid the sugared, marbled splendour, As an old priest quite solemn Preaching to young girls who laugh at him. Waltzes rush through the air like snakes, Dances like flopping birds, Bands of guitars twang, Mandolines send Liquid cubes, close knit with sound Through the whirl of striving music; As you hear the hooves of a galloping horse, And then, the blows of the rider. The whole town sways Pouring out it's people Who gather in the streets, march on: Hubbub throb of drums, Clangour and thrash of bells And the measured march And stamp of feet:-- A crash of movement On four short notes: Gestures of a marionette For either arm and both his legs-- And trumpet-calls Forked and quick as lightning.--              The crowd all gay with colour Blown along the road Like confetti when a wedding's over. Bars of colour, streaks of colour And sharp notes like a rapier's thrust, And the fevered clanging of the bells Rings out still more and more: Cataracts, curved blades of steel Falling        down            down Through ice-cold caverns: The clash of shields When ship meets ship And the fighters leap from boat to boat, The sea tossing her blue shoulders And the spray running salt unaccustomed tears Down every eager face, The whole wide Earth trembles and totters With the stamp of myriad feet. The fret and fury of a mighty army Following the foe through a level land. Swift as eagles the Saracen horse Fled my army through the sun-scorched sand. The furious trampling of horses stirred the desert Making the sand ring like a trumpet, Echoing the hoots, the howls, the heavy stamp of     hooves Raising hurricanes of dust to hide the stars--Wind-riven curtains of sand To hide those whirling dancers from our sight.                     

          V. THE HOME-COMING.The houses all are galloping toward me--Gymnasts on the tall trapezes of the wind. That dome there!Like an acrobat tumbling From the white bars that the clouds make! That broad arch Feet wide apart, Like any striding giant Comes nearer, nearer, Leaps right over me. The moon sends down fresh floods of milk Tall trees seem hands Plunged deep into the clouds That hang, fat udders, Whence the milk flows down. Seen against the pattern of broad leaves, That the tall trees make, The moon might wander in this park As free as any animal; And when a sudden darkness comes Till the beams shine out again--Without a doubt she left her pasture, Running in the soft grass, Shaking with her horns The star-fruit from the sun's gold orchards, Where the dew of his breath Lies like a soft bloom On the red fruit; And sure enough you see A star dart through the sky And fall into the smooth sea. A window opens And a voice calls out my name I stumble on the rough stones, Feel for my door. A piece of paper in the gutter Lies provocative. I blow my trumpet at it Till it reels into the air Floats slowly, turns red, Starts spinning, Darts like a flame Above the housetops. April 14th, 1918.           TRUMPETS.WOVEN from the tangled hair of comets On the never-ceasing shuttles of the wind, Night, thick Tabernacle for the sun, is pitched; And from the deepening gloom Ring out the trumpets Red and quick as sparks Before the vivifying camp-fire of the Gods. The blare of a Trumpet is brazen, fierce As the culminate charge that decides a battle.-- Great plumes like clouds wind-riven Float behind each fighter, And their armour glints and gleams in the Sun.-- The horses hooves beat loud, insistent,--As ominous and dire as kettledrums; The whole Earth's expectant. And the fields stretch green metallic As the leaden plated sky;--far off Small windows, kissed by the Sun's red lips Send back a shuddering echo To the blare of trumpets. The cottage smoke, so stiff and regular Goes creaking through the painted air And everything is waiting Watching in uncertainty. "PSITTACHUS EOIS IMITATRIX ALES INDlS"— Ovid. THE parrot's voice snaps out--No good to contradict-- What he says he'll say again: Dry facts, like biscuits,--His voice and vivid colours Of his breast and wings Are immemoriably old; Old dowagers dressed in crimped satin Boxed in their rooms Like specimens beneath a glass Inviolate--and never changing, Their memory of emotions dead; The ardour of their summers Sprayed like camphor On their silken parasols Intissued in a cupboard. Reflective, but with never a new thought The parrot sways upon his ivory perch--Then gravely turns a somersault Through rings nailed in the roof-- Much as the sun performs his antics As he climbs the aerial bridge We only see Through crystal prisms in a falling rain. March 1st, 1918TRAPEZE-SONG FROM "PERSPECTIVE." BENEATH the roof now . . . . . . Kick once more the gilded balustrade . . .                 . . . Now's your time . . . And then you'll be among the flowering trees That travel with you in the train ; Among the trees, and just beneath The creaking pulleys that manipulate them As rain is managed by the clouds That travel with it over sea and land. And in your flight diagonal Look down upon your audience-- Intent upon you, and as you move See their direction change, White faces sudden blotted out Like tears are wiped from eyes--(For an instant while you turn)-- Then full upon you once again. And as your senses daze Convert their movement into sound A pendulum for ever beating With a fevered interval between the beat-- (This, the movement when all heads are turned)-- Feel the hot air quiver up your legs and sides Surround you quite, like breaking waves On sands the sun has warmed. Then your pace begins to slacken Bird-like you hover Long before you light--While, once the danger of your turn is o'er The band will start again, And gently let you down, As in a net----February 18th, 1918."WHITSUN." HOW hot the bank on which we lie! The green paint is melted On the seat near by So that you cannot touch it! Small yellow flowers, glazed white with heat That snap like glass when you pick them, Grass like a parrot's wing Burnt yellow here and there By the Sun's hot stare. So high this cliff stands from the water That the drop itself into the cooler sea Makes a faint wind up here--Refreshing like cold water drunk from a spring, Or the wafting of far music On the bird-wings of a cool wind.
 The sea sleeps ever Under the Sun's hot trumpet, While patches of weed float in the water To make the surface darker--Where the dying Sun Has caught the windows of the town 
You see their glare reflected in the water A whorl of quivering sparks A crackle in the heart of waves-- While catspaws play among the weed Till the long strands raised on a wave's back Shine like wet hair in the Sun. One cloud far out, comes nearer Takes my soul back to the gray tunnel Of every year's hard work Till the young year's holiday, again. February 28th, 1918End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Heliodora, by Hilda Doolittle*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HELIODORA ******** This file should be named 62456-0.txt or 62456-0.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/2/4/5/62456/Produced by Tim Lindell, Chuck Greif and the OnlineDistributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net (Thisfile was produced from images generously made availableby The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computersincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It existsbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations frompeople in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundationand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary ArchiveFoundationThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the InternalRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identificationnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted athttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby     Chief Executive and Director     gbnewby@pglaf.orgSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for anyparticular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donationmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donateSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.orgThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
